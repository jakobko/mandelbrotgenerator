xMax = 1
yMin = -1.5
yMax = 1.5

Number of tests: 5

                          Time
Python implementation     5.35s
Numpy implementation      5.01s
Numba implementation      0.15s


# Comparison notes
Advantages of using Numba instead of Numpy is the extreme speedup that occurs because of the optimised code. It is also really easy to use.

Disadvantages might be that it needs to be installed as a an external dependency and it's hard to see where potential bugs occur.
